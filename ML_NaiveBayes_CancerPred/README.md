# Machine Learning Classifier in Python with Scikit-learn 
In this Project we implement a simple machine learning algorithm in Python using Scikit-learn, a machine learning tool for Python. 
Using a database of breast cancer tumor information, youâ€™ll use a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier that predicts whether or not a tumor is malignant or benign.

**The dataset we will be working with in this tutorial is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Database.** 

The dataset includes various informationabout breast cancer tumors, as well as classification labels of malignant or benign. 
The dataset has 5 6 9 instances, or data, on 569 tumors and includes information on 30 attributes, or features, such as the radius of the tumor, texture, smoothness, and area.
Using this dataset, we will build a machine learning model to usetumor information to predict whether or not a tumor is malignant orbenign.
Scikit-learn comes installed with various datasets which we can load into Python, and the dataset we want is included.
